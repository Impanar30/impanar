        <h1>Welcome to St.Joseph School</h1>
        <p>St Joseph's School was started in the year 2014. It is managed by the Fathers of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), a religious order of the Catholic Church, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1540. The Jesuits are active in the field of education throughout the world. In India, they have established many schools and colleges.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>World-affirming: Jesuit education acknowledges God as the Author of all reality, all truth and all knowledge. God is present and working in all of creation: in nature, in history and in person. Jesuit education, therefore, affirms the radical goodness of the world ‘charged with the grandeur of God.’ It regards every element of creation as worthy of study and contemplation and capable of endless exploration.</p>

      <div  class="container-md">
        <h2>Our Mision</h2>
        <p>The education in a Jesuit institution tries to create a sense of wonder and mystery in learning about God’s creation. A more complete knowledge of creation can lead to a greater knowledge of God and a greater willingness to work with God in his ongoing work of creation. Courses are taught in a way that students, in humble recognition of God’s presence, find joy in learning and thirst for greater and deeper knowledge.</p>
