        <h2>School Overview</h2>
        <p>St Joseph's School was started in the year 2014. It is managed by the Fathers of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), a religious order of the Catholic Church, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1540.

            The Jesuits are active in the field of education throughout the world. In India, they have established many schools and colleges. These institutions are part of the Catholic Church’s effort to impart education to the people of India and around the world. Jesuit education is inspired by the life and teaching of Jesus Christ whom our countrymen have always revered and admired. It is also based on the sound principles of character formation laid down by St. Ignatius of Loyola.</p>

        <h2>Our Motto-Faith and Toil</h2>
        <p>The motto of St Joseph's School is : FIDE ET LABORE in Latin, it means FAITH AND TOIL. At Joseph’s we commit ourselves to the spirit and ideals that have inspired several generations. Faith, among other things is the quintessence of humans. It makes humans to be committed to God, to their fellowmen and to intellectual pursuits. Toil is a necessary prerequisite for any success</p>
